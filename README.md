# demoApp Welcome

## Initial Setup
Clone the repo and run `npm install && bower install`.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Task

Create a simple single page application that allows users to design beer recipes. At a bare minimum, the UI should display
a search box for ingredients (eg. hops, grain, extract) and allow for the addition of multiple different ingredients.  
While saving is not a necessary mechanic to implement, assume that the ultimate output of this application is a saved recipe. 
We ask that you use Angular JS for this exercise.  It need not be something you are familiar with as part of the purpose of 
this exercise is to give you the opportunity to learn something new.  Remember that UX and UI count too!
